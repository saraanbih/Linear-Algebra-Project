# **Linear System Project**

A Windows Forms application designed to solve linear system equations using two methods: **Gauss-Jordan** and **Gaussian Elimination**. The application provides multiple ways for users to input equations or matrices and allows saving solutions as a PDF.

---

## **Features**  
1. **Multiple Solution Methods**:  
   - Gauss-Jordan  
   - Gaussian Elimination  

2. **Flexible Input Options**:  
   - Input equations directly.  
   - Specify the number of rows and columns, then input the matrix elements.

3. **Solution Display**:  
   - View step-by-step solutions.  

4. **Export Solution**:  
   - Save the solution as a PDF for future reference.
